# Chat-App
It’s a multi-client chat application which works on the concepts of connecting people who are in the same room.
It allows users to connect more than 10 people to connect easily through the room .



The chat app uses the Socket.IO library so that users can join a room and chat with individuals in that specific room. 
Current features in place include: join a room, send messages in that room, and send geolocation information.
As users enter and leave the room, the room list updates and an admin message announces the change.
